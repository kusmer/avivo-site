We help teachers and learners of all ages embrace music as a living language available to them for personal creative expression. We help educators creatively infuse their teaching with new life. We help students transform and enliven their relationship to music. We do all this by promoting a mother-tongue approach to music education in which students discover music vocabulary for themselves, engage in artful drills and games that build aural, intellectual, and creative facility, and finally create original music through improvisation and composition. This process informs everything we teach \u2013 from traditional instrument study, to theory &amp; aural skills, to electronic music and jazz. It is a process of teaching and learning with life.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<h5 class=\"toggle \"><a href=\"#\"><span class=\"arrow\"><\/span>Comprehensive<\/a><\/h5><div class=\"toggle-content \" style=\"\">\n<p>Avivo Teaching Artists have designed, developed, and implemented proven curricula in the areas of musicianship, computer musicianship, jazz musicianship, theory, solf\u00e8ge &amp; rhythms, choral studies, improvisation, composition, and private instrumental study.
