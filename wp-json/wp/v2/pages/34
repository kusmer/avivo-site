Prior to this she served for twelve years as a Lecturer in Music at Santa Clara University. During her tenure there she designed and implemented a unique, interactive two-year aural skills curriculum, which employs improvisation and composition at every level. She also created a course in Improvisation, in which students use their bodies, their voices, and their instruments to engage in playful activities that awaken their imagination, build creative vocabulary, deepen their understanding of the creative process, and lead incrementally to fully improvised art in various forms.<\/p>\n<p>From 1977 \u2013 1997 Patricia served as a faculty member of The Walden School, a summer school and festival for young musicians interested in improvisation and composition. In 1997 she assumed the role of Executive Director, a position she held until 2003. During this tenure helped create The Walden School Teacher Training Institute and subsequently served as its Director from 2004 \u2013 2012. She is an author of <em>The Walden School Musicianship Course: A Manual for Teachers<\/em> and co-authored two <em>Solf\u00e8ge &amp; Rhythms Supplements<\/em> to this text.<\/p>\n<p>Holding advanced degrees in piano performance from The Peabody Institute and San Francisco Conservatory, Patricia has performed with San Francisco Bay Area new music ensembles such as Earplay and San Francisco Contemporary Players. She has also served as a faculty member of the San Francisco Conservatory Preparatory Department and Chair of the Music Teachers National Association (MTNA) Composer Commissioning Program. She has lectured at state and national music conferences on topics such as \u201cImprovisational Music Theory\u201d and \u201cReleasing the Music Within\u201d, and has published articles that advocate learning music through the active process of its creation.<\/p>\n<p>Patricia is certified to teach InterPlay\u00ae, a philosophy and practice of improvisation designed to unlock the wisdom of our bodies and in our communities, and she is a former member of the dynamic San Francisco Bay Area performing group, Wing It!, an ensemble dedicated to mounting fully improvised performances combining dance, storytelling, and music. Believing that the arts offer significant opportunities for the expression and deepening of human spirituality, Patricia also serves as the Minister of Worship Arts for First Mennonite Church of San Francisco.<br \/>\n<\/div><div class=\"clearboth\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"one_fourth\"><style type='text\/css'>\n\t#imageframe-2.imageframe{float:;}\n\t#imageframe-2.imageframe img{border:4px solid #f6f6f6;}\n\t#imageframe-2.imageframe-glow img{\n\t\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t\tbox-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t}\n\t#imageframe-2.imageframe-dropshadow img{\n\t\t-moz-box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t\t-webkit-box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t\tbox-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t}\n\t<\/style>\n\t<span id=\"imageframe-2\" class=\"imageframe imageframe-bottomshadow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/avivo.com\/headshots\/pam-quist-500.jpg\" alt=\"Pam Quist\" \/><span class=\"imageframe-shadow-left\"><\/span><span class=\"imageframe-shadow-right\"><\/span><\/span>\n<h6>Photo by Aaron Blumenshine<\/h6>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"three_fourth last\">\n<a name=\"pam-quist\"><\/a><div class=\"title\"><h2>Pamela Layman Quist<\/h2><div class=\"title-sep-container\"><div class=\"title-sep\"><\/div><\/div><\/div>\n<p>Dr. Pamela Quist, a strong advocate for encouraging creativity in all aspects of music education, has taught composition and musicianship for 45 years. A founder and former Director of The Walden School, Dr. Quist was a co-author of <em>The Walden School Musicianship Course: A Manual for Teachers.<\/em> She served as an adjunct faculty member and Lecturer at Santa Clara University from 2001-2012 where she taught private composition and beginning composition class, all levels of music theory, counterpoint, Performance and Culture, music history, and specialty courses such as Women and Music. During her time at SCU, Dr. Quist designed and implemented a theory curriculum that was closely integrated with Santa Clara\u2019s aural skills program designed by her long-time colleague, Patricia Plude.<\/p>\n<p>Prior to 2001, Pamela Quist taught in several collegiate and conservatory programs while maintaining an active private studio in Baltimore, MD. As a composer, she has written for various chamber ensembles, full orchestra, and solo instruments. Her list of works includes a piano concerto, a tuba concerto and various vocal and choral pieces. Requiem for the People for SATB Chorus and Orchestra was enthusiastically received in 2006 when it was performed in Prague and Vienna following its premiere performance at the Mission in Santa Clara, CA.<\/p>\n<p>A graduate of The Peabody Institute of Johns Hopkins University with a degree in piano performance and advanced degrees in music composition, Pamela Quist was a faculty member at SUNY Geneseo, Peabody Conservatory, Peabody Preparatory Department, Essex Community College, and in the Johns Hopkins University Continuing Studies program. During her years of study at Peabody Conservatory, Pamela came to know and admire composer Earle Brown and his music, thus leading to her doctoral dissertation, Indeterminate Form in the Work of Earle Brown (1984). This association influenced Quist\u2019s own compositions by increasing her interest in improvisation as a tool for expression in structurally indeterminate works and also in pieces with specific macrostructures.<\/p>\n<p>Composition students of Pamela Quist\u2019s have been winners in the BMI and ASCAP competitions, the Delius High School Composition Contest, the National Guild of Community Schools of the Arts competition and the MTNA National Student competition (\u201975, \u201979, \u201883, \u201886, \u201889, \u201990, and \u201994). For five years from 1990 through 1994, her students were winners in the Baltimore Choral Arts Young Composer Project having their choral works performed in public concert and broadcast locally. In addition many of Quist\u2019s students have gone on to attain higher degrees from universities and conservatories and have active careers in music.<\/p>\n<p>Dr. Quist\u2019s current private studio is in San Jose, CA where she encourages students ranging in age from 10 to adult to create original music through improvisation and composition. Since 2011 Pam Quist has also been the director of a choral ensemble at Peninsula Bible Church Willow Glen. In all areas of her teaching, composing and choral directing, Pamela Quist uses the educational philosophy and the solid approach to building skills and deep musical comprehension originated by her mentor, Grace Newsom Cushman.<br \/>\n<\/div><div class=\"clearboth\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"one_fourth\"><style type='text\/css'>\n\t#imageframe-3.imageframe{float:;}\n\t#imageframe-3.imageframe img{border:4px solid #f6f6f6;}\n\t#imageframe-3.imageframe-glow img{\n\t\t-moz-box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t\t-webkit-box-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t\tbox-shadow: 0 0 3px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* outer glow *\/\n\t}\n\t#imageframe-3.imageframe-dropshadow img{\n\t\t-moz-box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t\t-webkit-box-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t\tbox-shadow: 2px 3px 7px rgba(0,0,0,.3); \/* drop shadow *\/\n\t}\n\t<\/style>\n\t<span id=\"imageframe-3\" class=\"imageframe imageframe-bottomshadow\"><img src=\"http:\/\/avivo.com\/headshots\/leo-wanenchak-500.jpg\" alt=\"Leo Wanenchak\" \/><span class=\"imageframe-shadow-left\"><\/span><span class=\"imageframe-shadow-right\"><\/span><\/span><\/div>\n<div class=\"three_fourth last\">\n<a name=\"leo-wanenchak\"><\/a><div class=\"title\"><h2>Leo Wanenchak<\/h2><div class=\"title-sep-container\"><div class=\"title-sep\"><\/div><\/div><\/div>\nAn accomplished choral director, pianist, organist, composer and educator, Leo Wanenchak\u2019s experience with Grace Cushman\u2019s Musicianship Course curriculum dates back more than three decades when he and Patricia Plude received their intensive training as new Walden faculty with Walden co-founders Pamela Quist and David Hogan.

At Luther College, his composition studio often collaborates with other departments to create evening-length performances. This fall, students worked with an early music ensemble to create a program called \u201cShakespeare through Song and Sound,\u201d in which six new compositions were created that either set Shakespeare\u2019s words or responded to his poetry.
