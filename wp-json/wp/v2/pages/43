We are a community of musicians devoted to the art of teaching drawn together by the legacy of educator Grace Newsom Cushman. We believe in teaching music as a language that is available to all as a means for personal creative expression. Our approach engages both the teacher and the learner in actively building fluency with musical materials, playfully experimenting with new concepts, and thoroughly integrating these materials and concepts in wholehearted self-expression through original creation. We serve the music community by offering workshops, mentorships, curricular consultations, and publications that make music education a lively and transformative experience.<\/p>\n<p>Here are examples of the kinds of work Avivo Teaching Artists have done in the past.

His blog remained as the top search result for electronic music in the Korean language (\uc804\uc790\uc74c\uc545) for five years. Through this blog Joo Won met a great number of students and collaborators, and many online meetings turned into opportunities for performance and teaching. Building on what he had learned, Joo Won then went on to create a new online educational project: the production of 100 videos of live electronic music (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.100strangesounds.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">www.100strangesounds.com<\/a>). Project dates: September 2005-August 2006. Teaching Artist Mentor: Tom Lopez.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Erika&#8217;s Project: <\/strong>Erika applied tools and teaching concepts used by Avivo artists to develop a course for teaching music fundamentals through the voice. &nbsp;Using slinkys, balloons and rubberbands she made the experiments and resulting discoveries accessible and understandable to beginning vocal students. While approaching the acoustics topic of sound and \u201cenvelope\u201d, Erika set up a parallel between \u201cattack, sustain, and release\u201d and learning specific vocal techniques. Throughout this groundbreaking work, the author continuously invented new and challenging ways to drill music elements using the voice alone. Project dates: December 2010-July 2011. Teaching Artist Mentor: Dr. Pamela Quist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Meighan&#8217;s Project: <\/strong>Meighan strengthened her personal musicianship and improvisation skills using materials developed by Avivo teaching artists. Specifically, she studied modes, modal harmony, and seventh chords as consonant sonorities. Using her increased confidence with improvisation, she facilitated an improvisation workshop with her chamber ensemble for high school music students. She also explored creative application activities in her lessons with private clarinet and piano students. Project Dates: October 2007 &#8211; August 2008. Teaching Artist Mentor: Bill Stevens.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dina&#8217;s Project: <\/strong>Dina expanded her own piano horizons through improvisation and composition, while concurrently exploring ways to encourage students to create from the very beginning of the learning process.

Converting carefully designed practice techniques to guitar, he also provides ways to encourage creativity through individual and group improvisations on basic materials like musical intervals. Today he is using these fresh and exciting methods on a regular basis in his guitar teaching. Project dates: September 2007-July 2008. Teaching Artist Mentor: Dr. Pamela Quist.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fay\u2019s Project: <\/strong>Fay constructed and implemented a plan to systematically introduce solf\u00e8ge and rhythms (as detailed in the <i>Solf\u00e8ge &amp; Rhythms Supplement<\/i> to <i>The Walden School Musicianship Course: A Manual for Teachers<\/i>) to her elementary music students from pre-K through Grade 5.&nbsp; She also introduced solf\u00e8ge and rhythms work into rehearsals with her children\u2019s choir. As part of this implementation process Fay continued to develop her own personal fluency with the syllables and hand signs as well as comfort with the drills and games used in this curriculum. Her ultimate goal for this project was to give students effective musicianship tools that would enable them to sing with more accurate pitch, take significant steps toward gaining fluent music reading skills, and finally achieve a much richer and more satisfying vocal and choral experience.
